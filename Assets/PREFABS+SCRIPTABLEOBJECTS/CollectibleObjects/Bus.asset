  m_text: In the 1950s and 1960s people across the country worked to outlaw racial
    discrimination against African Americans. This is known as the Civil Rights Movement.
    In 1964 the Civil Rights Act was passed by the U.S. Congress and stated that all
    Americans have the right to use public places and services. It also says that
    people cannot refuse to hire people because of their race, religion, gender, or
    place of birth.
