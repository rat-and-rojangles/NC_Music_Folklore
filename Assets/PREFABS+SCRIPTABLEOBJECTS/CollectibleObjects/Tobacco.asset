  m_text: 'Beginning in the 1600s, African people were stolen from Africa and brought
    to North America as slaves, where they were forced to work for white people for
    no pay, with very poor living conditions. Enslaved people did not have adequate
    shelter, food, or clothing and had to work long hours every day of the week. Even
    though they were largely forbidden from playing their traditional music, people
    used song privately as a way to cope with the tragedy of slavery and to communicate
    with other people.  '
