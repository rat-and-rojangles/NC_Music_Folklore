    and b-girls dance to. This was first done by finding a record with a rhythmic
    \u201Cbreak\u201D in it (a part with no words and a compelling beat), taking two
    copies of this record, and then using the two records back and forth to play the
    same \u2018break\u2019 over and over again, extending the brief beat into a long
    sequence. "
