  m_text: "The first Historically Black Colleges and Universities were founded immediately
    after the Civil War. Previously, there had been laws prohibiting teaching enslaved
    people how to read and write. Freed men and women established HBCUs specifically
    for the education of African Americans during a time of segregated and limited
    access to schools. Shaw University was North Carolina\u2019s first HBCU. There
    are 12 HBCUs in North Carolina today. They remain an important part of African
    American history and education."
